        <h1>St Theresa's, Shannon Rovers & Sam Maguire's </h1>

         <p>
            The club has a long history dating back to 1967 when St Theresa's GAA club was first formed by Joe Lynch and others. 
            The club won numerous cups, shields and league titles and competed for several years at senior grade in both league 
            and championship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sam Maguire GAA club was based in Holloway Road and was formed in the early 1980's by Mick Cafferkey and Kevin Lavelle. 
            The club competed at intermediate level, winning various cups and shields.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shannon Rovers GAA club was formed in 1982 by Brendan Dooley, John Coleman and others. The club was based in Wood Green 
            and won the intermediate championship in 1994.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following this fruitful period, player numbers dwindled and it was agreed at a joint AGM in 1996 that the two clubs would 
            merge forming Shannon Rovers/Sam Maguires. The club went on to win the Intermediate League, Shields Cup, Murphy Cup and 
            most notably the Championship in 2002 captained by Michael Higgins.

        <h1>North London Shamrocks</h1>
        <p>
            The North London Shamrocks GFC was formed in 2005 by an amalgamation of St Theresa's of Ponders End and Shannon Rovers/Sam 
            Maguires of Wood Green. Tom Galvin, Ollie Cormac and Tom Kilcommons brought about the successful amalgamation of the neighbouring 
            clubs to ensure that North London continued to have a GAA football club. The new club was named North London Shamrocks and 
            now competes at intermediate level in both league and championship.
