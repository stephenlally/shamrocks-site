              Having agonisingly lost three finals in the past, the squad galvanised by the new management team 
              of Paddy Madigan, Declan Treanor and Brian Conaghan finally got over the final hurdle to land the 
              trophy in the clubs tenth season.

              Championship, a grade which is very competitive.
