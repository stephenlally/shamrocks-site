               North London Shamrocks will be playing Senior Championship Football in 2015 after a fantastic 3-12 to 0-9 win over St Brendan’s . It was a terrific 
               team performance, in particular the first half where goals from Danny O’Reilly, Bryan Smith and (we can’t believe it either) Pat Lynch gave the 
               Shamrocks a commanding 3-06 to 0-03 lead. We would like to wish St Brendan’s well for next season. Congratulations must go to the all the players, 
               the management of Patrick Madigan, Declan Treanor and Brian Conaghan and to everyone involved with the committee on this historic moment for the club.  
               The club would also like to thank all our supporters who made the trip out to Ruislip on Sunday.

            <p>
              The North London Shamrocks were saddened to hear of the passing of George O Connell.
            </p>
            <p>
              George O Connell was a proud GAA servant in Kerry and London and was a founder member of Shannon Rovers GAA Club  in Wood Green in 1982. He proudly
              served the club in various positions and was eventually Life President of the club. He gave his support to the establishment of North London Shamrocks GAA
              Club in 2005 due to the massive commitments in earlier years of himself and other Gaels in clubs in North London. He and his family attended 3 North 
              London Shamrocks Dinner dances even though he was not always in the best of health and especially enjoyed the nights when Kerry legends Darrah O Se and Pat Spillane were guests.
            </p>
            <p>
              The funeral arrangements are as follows.<br>
