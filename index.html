              North London Shamrocks created club history on Saturday in Ruslip as they won their first piece of
              silverware, the Murphy Cup beating Tara 1.09 - 1.06.

            <p>
              Having agonisingly lost three finals in the past, the squad galvanised by the new management team 
              of Paddy Madigan, Declan Treanor and Brian Conaghon finally got over the final hurdle to land the 
              trophy in the clubs tenth season.
            </p>
            <p>
              The club know that they need to use this as platform to build on to challenge for the Intermediate 
              Championship, a grade which is very competitive.

              The most eagerly awaited fixture of the opening round of the Intermediate Championship saw NLS in action v Cuchullians in Ruislip last Sunday. 
              Despite a courageous performance from NLS we were beaten by a score of 3-08 to 0-11. After going in two points down at HT, with the breeze at their 
              backs NLS fought back strongly to take a two point lead into the final minutes of the game. However, with only 5 minutes (+ injury time) left, 
              CuChullians stole in for two quickfire goals and tagged on a free and a score from play to take victory. Overall, the scoreline flattered the victors 
              and NLS management were proud of the team and individual players efforts. It's still all to play for with a must win fixture vs Harlseden Harps in a 
              fortnight. Best for NLS on the day were D O'Regan and V Murphy.
            </p>

              Two games for NLS this Saturday, 13th of July. Intermediate league, NLS v Heston Gaels @ 3.30 and Reserve League, NLS v Fulham Irish @ 5pm. 
              Both games are fixed for Donkey Lane. Unfortunately the reserve fixture vs Parnells last weekend wasn't played as Parnells weren't able to field. NLS 
              Reserves were awarded the points for the fixture which consolidates their position at the top of the reserve league.
              Training continues Tuesday and Thursday evenings @ 7.30pm sharp in Donkey Lane. Please see our website for location/directions.
